# How to host your own replays and logs
- Clone this repo
- (If you don't have NodeJS 18.x.x) Run downloadnode.html for a redirect, or look up NodeJS and download version 18
- Paste your replays/log files into "replays" or "logs" folder(s)
- Run "upload.bat"
- Commit changes

# Hosting Github Pages
- Go to your repo clone's main page
- Click "Settings" (it has a gear icon and it's near the top middle of the screen)
- Locate the "Pages" settings area
- Make sure it deploys from "main" branch (whatever you main branch is called with your files)
- You can now view your webpage once it deploys, or you can choose to add a cusotm domain if you own one.
